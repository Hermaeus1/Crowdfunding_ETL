Project 2
This Repo contains a project worked on by Serena Hollis, Ethan Clark, and Riley Sayre. The goal of the project was to import data from various excel files and reformat them into more readable and usable formats. The Repo contains the jupyter notebook file that creates and edits the dataframes as well as the database files and csvs.
